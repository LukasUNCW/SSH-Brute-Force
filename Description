# SSH Brute Force

The following Python script performs a brute-force attack on an open SSH service, attempting to guess a password for a specified user on a remote server. 

It uses the 'pwn' and 'paramiko' libraries to automate the process of testing multiple passwords against an SSH server running on '127.0.0.1' (the local machine). 

The passwords are read from a popular password dictionary file called 'rockyou.txt'.

This script is useful for testing the strength of SSH password authentication using a list of common passwords. 

It should only be used on machines you own or have permission to test. Unauthorized use could be considered illegal and unethical.

To install the libraries, run the following commands inside your desired IDE terminal, pip install pwn, pip install paramiko.
